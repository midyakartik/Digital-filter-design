# Digital-filter-design
In the realm of digital signal processing, our project focuses on the design and implementation of a Digital Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. FIR filters are fundamental components used for various signal processing tasks such as noise reduction, signal enhancement, and frequency shaping. This project delves into the theoretical foundations of FIR filters, exploring concepts like filter design, filter coefficients, and windowing techniques. Through software implementation using programming languages like Python or MATLAB, we aim to create a functional FIR filter that can be applied to real-world signals. By experimenting with different filter orders, cut-off frequencies, and window functions, we seek to understand how these parameters affect the filter's performance in terms of frequency response, phase shift, and transient response. This project not only offers an opportunity to grasp the core principles of digital signal processing but also provides hands-on experience in designing and applying essential filtering techniques to manipulate digital signals effectively.
